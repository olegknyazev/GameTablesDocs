# Google Sheets Authorization

When using a Google Sheets speardsheet as a source for Game Tables, you have to authorize in Google and grant access for Game Tables application. To do so perform the following actions:

1. Open a Game Table with Source set to Google Sheets or Game Tables' Preferences window.
2. Click Authorize button. You will be redirected to Google authorization page in your default web browser.
3. Allow everything here...
4. After a message saying that you may close a browser tab appeared you may go back to Unity Editor and use Game Tables with Google Sheets.

Game Tables will have access to all your documents in Google Docs. It does mean that you may import data from any spreadsheet you have access to.

Authorization is performed per-user. Authorization data is not stored in project. It's recommended to use separate accounts for everyone on the project who imports data from Google Sheets. You may set up these accounts to have access to a shared project or company account.

There're two separate processes: grant access to Game Tables application and authorization in google.
