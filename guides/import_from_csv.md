# Import from CSV
To set up importing from a CSV file, perform the following actions:
1. Create a Game Table object.
2. Set up Game Table object properties:
    1. Choose CSV as Source.
    2. Specify a Text Asset from the project that will be interpreted as a CSV file.
    3. Specify where to search for prefabs whose properties should be updated by the data from CSV.
    4. Optional. Specify additional settings that alter the way table data is interpreted. For example, you may put properties for several types of objects into a single table (Islands mode) or choose whether to use object-per-row or property-per-row layout. For more see !!!
