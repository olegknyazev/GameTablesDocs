This section describes basic workflow that you follow when using Game Tables.

The most basic idea that you need to know about Game Tables is a GameTable object. You create these objects in the Project window. Each of these objects represent a single table source (which may contain several sheets, though) that may be applied to a set of [Prefabs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) or [ScriptableObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html).
